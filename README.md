# Ex.No.9 - SIMULATION OF POST PROCESSING IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING

### DATE: 

## AIM: 
To simulate the post processing of 3d printed parts via support Removal, UV Curing & Heat Treatment.

## REQUIREMENTS:
System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

### Procedure for support removal
 1.	Select support removal from the list.
 2.	All the parts related to support removal are shown on the screen.
 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
 5.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

### Procedure for UV Curing
 1.	Select UV curing from the list.
 2.	All the parts related to UV curing are shown on the screen.
 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
 4.	When the first part will be selected then it will open in the blank space on the left side of the screen.
 5.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

### Procedure for heat treatment
 1.	Select heat treatment from the list.
 2.	All the parts related to heat treatment are shown on the screen.
 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
 5.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

##### Explanation :

Examine the 3D printed object and look for areas where support structures were automatically generated. These structures are typically located underneath overhanging or complex parts of the model. They provide temporary support during printing to ensure successful fabrication.Take a closer look at the attachment points where the support structures connect to the main object. These points can be crucial when planning how to remove the supports effectively. Identifying weak points or areas where the supports are less integrated with the main object will help minimize the risk of damaging the printed model.

##### Explanation :

Determine the type of support material used, such as soluble supports made from materials like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Understanding the support material is crucial in selecting the appropriate chemical solution for removal. Choose a chemical solution that is compatible with the support material. For water-soluble supports like PVA, water is typically used as a solvent. However, other materials may require specific solvents such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or proprietary solutions. Dilute the chemical solution according to the manufacturer's instructions, considering factors like concentration and temperature for optimal effectiveness.
